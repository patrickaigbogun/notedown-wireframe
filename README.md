**contibution guidelines**; 
work on dev branch for new features, bug fixes and all that
pr into test
it works 
pr into main
simple
dev is where we fuck around
test is where we find out
main is production environment 

f you want to do something minor like committing your changes somewhere so you can pull then use a `temp` branch. you create a temp branch with your name as such, temp-patrick, push your changes there and git pull from main then pr your temp into your working branch, merge then delete temp branch.
